This is the home of the Software Delivery Machine (SDM) framework and
related projects.

The SDM framework enables you to control your delivery process in
code.  Think of it as an API for your software delivery.  See this
[introduction][atomist-doc] for more information on the concept of a
Software Delivery Machine and how to create and develop on an SDM.
